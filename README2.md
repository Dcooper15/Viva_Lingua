<strong>Stretch Goals Completed:</strong>
A stretch goal we completed was to implement front-end code to add a specified language page that would pull the data for that language dynamically.

<br>
<br>

<strong>Stretch Goals for the Future:</strong>
A stretch goal that we are in the proccess of finishing is being able to upload media files and have them display dynamically. A styling stretch goal is to implement third-party CSS frameworks into node. 


<br>

<strong>Challenges & Solutions:</strong>
A big challenge for this project was to get the correct data to pull from our database and display dynamically on our various pages. We solved this problem by using a variety of SQL statements such as INNER JOINS, LEFT JOINS, and RIGHT JOINS to link our data tables properly.
